Code for final year project, biometric access control. UTTN 2022.

The contents of this repository are exclusive to the integration of the final year project developed by students of UTTN.

The main goal was to research, develop and implement an access control system aimed towards institutional use. The latter uses several widespread technologies
that enables a thrustworthy locally developed system, capable of granting secure educational space access to students. While reducing the workload to academics
by the automation of mundane tasks.

We strive in a fast developing world, and we want everyone to be able to further develop, implement, and maintain such system by sharing the knowledge and expertise we gained. We believe in a free world in which the primary source of wealth is knowledge.

Thanks to the contributors, open source software and academics for pushing us further into learning.

RV 2022.
